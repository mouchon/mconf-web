    faq0: 
      answer: "This FAQ, as this entire website, is based on Global Plaza. If you don’t find here the answer you’re looking for, maybe you can find it in the <a href=\"http://globalplaza.org/faq\">Global Plaza FAQ</a>."
      question: "About this FAQ"
    faq1: 
      answer: "Mconf is an open source project that aims to provide a webconference system with the capability to interoperate transparently between desktop computers and mobile devices.<br><br>This website you're on is called Mconf-Web, the web application that manages the webconferences in Mconf. Mconf-Web is built on top of <a href=\"http://globalplaza.org\">Global Plaza</a> that is (as stated in it's own website): \"a space for collaboration, a meeting point for professionals, where they can share documents and videos and organize and participate in videoconferences, in a modern web environment\".<br><br>You can find more about Mconf and Mconf-Web in the following websites:<ul><li>Our project's page: <a href=\"http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/prav/gtmconf\">http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/prav/gtmconf</a></li><li>Our Google Code page, with issue tracking and documentation (wiki): <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/mconf\">http://code.google.com/p/mconf</a></li><li>Our GitHub user, where all our code is hosted: <a href=\"https://github.com/mconf\">https://github.com/mconf</a></li></ul>"
      question: "What is Mconf?"
    faq2: 
      answer: "To start collaborating in Mconf you only need to <a href=\"http://mconf.inf.ufrgs.br/signup\">register</a>. That way you will be able to create spaces, add documents and attend meetings. Checking Mconf help pages is a nice starting point to find your way.<br><br>Free? Yes, you can use this server for free, but be aware that this is a test server and we do not guarantee that it will be running 100% of the time (though it will probably be close to that)."
      question: "How do I join and participate in the community? Is it free?"
    faq3: 
      answer: "A <b>space</b> is the basic unit of collaboration in Mconf. As you might guess, it is a place where people with a common interest can interact. That interaction can take place in a number of ways: using the document repository, organizing events, participating in webconferences, and others. And Mconf provides you with the facilities to do that, and much more. You only have to decide who to invite to your space, and if it will be public or private.<br><br><b>Public spaces</b> are viewable by anyone, even by visitors that do not have an account in Mconf. But, even though everyone can view it, only authorized people can alter it (create events and post messages, for example).<br><br><b>Private spaces</b> are only viewable by authorized people. You can create a private space and only give access to your friends or to people from your workplace, for example. Nobody else will be able to see the activity inside this space (but they will know that the space exists)."
      question: "Spaces? What spaces? What the heck are spaces?"
    faq4: 
      answer: "Mconf is a site that revolves around webconferencing and, as such, our mind is in simplifying the effort to organize them. Underneath, Mconf uses a customized version of <a href=\"http://bigbluebutton.org\">BigBlueButton</a> as the webconference system, and Mconf-Web allows you to create and manage your own webconferences."
      question: "Did you mention… webconferences?"
    faq5: 
      answer: "There are basically two types of webconferences in Mconf.<br><br>When a user registers in this website, he/she automatically receives a webconference room (<b>user’s room</b>). This room can be shared with anyone the user would like to hold a conference with, even with people that do not have a Mconf account. The room’s owner is always the conference moderator, while the other participants have limited attendee privileges.<br><br>The user rooms are by default public, so anyone with the link to it will be able to access it. But it can be made private and you can even define a password to it (note: this is still a work in progress).<br><br>The other type of webconference happens inside a space. Every space created in Mconf has a webconference room associated (<b>space’s room</b>). If the space is public, the room is public. Otherwise, the room is private and there will be a password associated to it.<br><br>As public spaces, public space’s rooms can be accessed by anybody, but only the space’s members will have moderator privileges. Likewise, private space’s rooms will only be accessible by members of the space."
      question: "Ok, but how can I create a webconference?"
    faq6: 
      answer: "As of now, we give support to the following languages: <b>English</b> and <b>Portuguese (Brazil)</b>. However, we also have Mconf-Web partially available in the languages <b>Spanish</b>, <b>French</b> and <b>German</b>. To select among them just use the link “Language” at the top of any page. We are constantly improving internationalization, and if you think you can lend us a hand, please <a href=\"http://mconf.inf.ufrgs.br/feedback/new\">contact us</a> or <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/mconf/wiki/MconfWebLocalization\">take a look at our wiki</a>, that contains some instructions on how to translate this website."
      question: "I am Spanish/French/German/Brazilian... Is Mconf translated to my language?"
    faq7: 
      answer: "You’re great! We are very glad you’re interested in giving your contribution to Mconf. So, how can you contribute?<br><br>First, take a look at our <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/mconf\">Google Code page</a>, where you can find the issue tracking system with all tasks currently in development and also all our documentation (wiki). After that, if you want to contact us, register yourself in <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/mconf-dev\">our mailing list</a> and send us a message.<br><br>There are plenty of things you can do. You can help by solving a bug, maybe? Or, if you’re not a developer, maybe you can install Mconf and provide some feedback? You can also help with translations if you speak many languages. We will appreciate any comments and suggestions, feel free to interact with us."

Also, you might wnat to provide documents needed for the meeting or later share pictures taken at the meeting.<li>The <b><a href=%{url_vm}>Virtual meeting </a></b>type is suited for online meetings or physical meetings with a strong virtual component, meaning that both local and remote participants will have the opportunity to communicate interactively.<li>The <b> <a href=%{url_vc}>Virtual congress</a> </b>type is very similar to <i>the virtual meeting</i> but geared for larger events, both in size and complexity.
